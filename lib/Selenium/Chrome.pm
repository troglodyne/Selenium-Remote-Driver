=head1 NAME

Selenium::Chrome - Use ChromeDriver without a Selenium server

=head1 VERSION

version 0.2450

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    my $driver = Selenium::Chrome->new;

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This class allows you to use the ChromeDriver without needing the JRE
or a selenium server running. When you refrain from passing the
C<remote_server_addr> and C<port> arguments, we will search for the
chromedriver executable binary in your $PATH. We'll try to start the
binary connect to it, shutting it down at the end of the test.

If the chromedriver binary is not found, we'll fall back to the
default L<Selenium::Remote::Driver> behavior of assuming defaults of
127.0.0.1:4444 after waiting a few seconds.

If you specify a remote server address, or a port, we'll assume you
know what you're doing and take no additional behavior.

If you're curious whether your Selenium::Chrome instance is using a
separate ChromeDriver binary, or through the selenium server, you can
check the C<binary_mode> attr after instantiation.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES

=head2 binary

Optional: specify the path to your binary. If you don't specify
anything, we'll try to find it on our own via L<File::Which/which>.

=head2 binary_port

Optional: specify the port that we should bind to. If you don't
specify anything, we'll default to the driver's default port. Since
there's no a priori guarantee that this will be an open port, this is
_not_ necessarily the port that we end up using - if the port here is
already bound, we'll search above it until we find an open one.

See L<Selenium::CanStartBinary/port> for more details, and
L<Selenium::Remote::Driver/port> after instantiation to see what the
actual port turned out to be.
